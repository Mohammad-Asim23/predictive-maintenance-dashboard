This project provides a predictive maintenance dashboard using IoT and AI. The dashboard displays real-time sensor data and allows users to customize how they view the data. It also includes a demo mode that reads sensor data from an Excel file.

## Features

- Real-time sensor data monitoring using MQTT.
- Customizable graphs (gauge, line, bar) with adjustable min/max values and colors.
- Demo mode that reads data from an Excel file.
- Supports predictive maintenance for industrial equipment.
